# Release migrations — run as root by /usr/local/sbin/yggdrasil-update after the app code is
# swapped. MUST be idempotent (it runs on every update) and MUST never assume network beyond
# what the update itself needed. Keep each step tiny, guarded, and commented with the release
# that introduced it.

# --- v0.8: time sync (TLS depends on a correct clock) -------------------------------------
# ISOs v0.4–v0.7 shipped without an NTP client; a drifted clock breaks all HTTPS including
# the updater. New ISOs bake systemd-timesyncd; this backfills machines that update to v0.8+.
